Let's design a simple yet interesting Python program that aligns with the motto "A Better World by Design." Given the broad nature of this motto, there are countless problems we could address. One interesting problem could be waste management, specifically recycling.

Python Program: Recycling Guide Game
The Interesting Problem:
Many people want to recycle but are often unsure about which items are recyclable and which are not. This leads to a lot of recyclable materials ending up in landfills and non-recyclable items contaminating recycling batches.

The Solution:
A Python-based quiz game that educates users on what can and cannot be recycled. This interactive game will present items and ask the user to decide whether the item is recyclable. This serves both educational and entertainment purposes.

Target Users:
The game is intended for individuals of all ages who want to learn more about recycling and make environmentally conscious decisions in their daily lives.

Usage:
Users will play the game to improve their knowledge of recycling practices, contributing to a better world by promoting sustainability through proper waste disposal.
